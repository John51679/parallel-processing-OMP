# parallel-processing-OMP
This project was created as part of "Parallel Processing" subject in Computer Engineering &amp; Informatics Department (CEID) of University of Patras. It involves optimization of a given serial code, using openMP in `C`.

The parallelism is achieved in four different ways.

- Static Thread Scheduling
- Dynamic Thread Scheduling
- One Threading Task 
- Two threading Tasks
